## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/human37/open-wispr/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The script handles everything: installs via Homebrew, walks you through granting permissions, downloads the Whisper model, and starts the service. You'll see live feedback as each step completes.

A waveform icon appears in your menu bar when it's running.

The default hotkey is the **Globe key** (🌐, bottom-left). Hold it, speak, release.

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/human37/open-wispr/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | bash
```

This stops the service, removes the formula, tap, config, models, app bundle, logs, and permissions.

## Configuration

Edit `~/.config/open-wispr/config.json`:

```json
{
  "hotkey": { "keyCode": 63, "modifiers": [] },
  "modelSize": "base.en",
  "language": "en",
  "spokenPunctuation": false
}
```

Then restart: `brew services restart open-wispr`

| Option | Default | Values |
|---|---|---|
| **hotkey** | `63` | Globe (`63`), Right Option (`61`), F5 (`96`), or any key code |
| **modifiers** | `[]` | `"cmd"`, `"ctrl"`, `"shift"`, `"opt"` — combine for chords |
| **modelSize** | `"base.en"` | See model table below |
| **language** | `"en"` | Any [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) — e.g. `it`, `fr`, `de`, `es` |
| **spokenPunctuation** | `false` | Say "comma", "period", etc. to insert punctuation instead of auto-punctuation |

### Models

Larger models are more accurate but slower and use more memory. The default `base.en` is a good balance for most users.

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tiny.en` | 75 MB | Fastest | Lower | Quick notes, short phrases |
| **`base.en`** | 142 MB | **Fast** | **Good** | **Most users (default)** |
| `small.en` | 466 MB | Moderate | Better | Longer dictation, technical terms |
| `medium.en` | 1.5 GB | Slower | Best | Maximum accuracy, complex speech |

> **Non-English languages:** Models ending in `.en` are English-only. To use another language, switch to the equivalent model without the `.en` suffix (e.g. `base.en` → `base`) and set the `language` field to your language code. Multilingual models are slightly less accurate for English but support 99 languages.

> **Modifier-only hotkeys:** Left and right modifier keys are matched by physical key. If you set `61` (`rightoption`), left Option (`58`) will not trigger it.

> **Invalid config handling:** If `config.json` contains invalid JSON or unsupported values, open-wispr uses defaults for that run and prints a warning, but does not overwrite your file.

If the Globe key opens the emoji picker: **System Settings → Keyboard → "Press 🌐 key to" → "Do Nothing"**
